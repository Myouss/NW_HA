    # --- Advanced Options ---
    # The following advanced options are not usually needed. To use an advanced option, remove
    # the comment indicator, #, before the parameter name and specify an appropriate value.
    #
    # networkTag: [TAG]
    #    Adds network tags to your instance. This is useful if you do routing or define
    #    firewall rules by tags. By default, no tags are added to your VM. Multiple tags
    #    can be assigned by separating them with commas
    #
    # publicIP: [No | Yes]
    #    Defines whether a public IP address should be added to your VM. By default this is
    #    set to Yes. Note that if you set this to No without appropriate network nat and
    #    tags in place, there will be no route to the internet and thus the installation will
    #    fail.
    #
    # serviceAccount: [CUSTOM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]
    #    By default, the VM's will be deployed using the default project service account. If
    #    you wish, you can create your own service account with locked down permissions and
    #    specify the name of the account here. Note that an incorrectly defined service
    #    account will prevent a successful deployment. Example of a correctly specified
    #    custom service account: myserviceuser@myproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    #
    # --- Developer Options ---
    # post_deployment_script: [SCRIPT_URL]
    #    Specifies the location of a script to run after the deployment is complete.
    #    The script should be hosted on a web server or in a GCS bucket. The URL should
    #    begin with http:// https:// or gs://. Note that this script will be executed
    #    on all VM's that the template creates. If you only want to run it on the master
    #    instance you will need to add a check at the top of your script.
